# Differential Absentee Ballot Rejection Rates

## Summary

Although absentee voting/vote-by-mail (VBM) may be a safe alternative to voting in person, it might disenfranchise underserved communities. A missing witness signature or a non-official envelope might disqualify a ballot. And rejection rates can vary widely across socio-demographic groups. A [study](https://electionscience.clas.ufl.edu/files/2020/04/Baringer_Herron_Smith_VBM_FL.pdf) of voting lists in Florida found that the absentee ballot rejection rates for minorities are twice as large as for white Americans (approximately 2% vs 1%). Other studies from elections in [LA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261379408000796) and [Georgia](https://electionscience.clas.ufl.edu/files/2020/05/GA_Venmo.pdf)  found higher rejection rates from first-time and non-white voters.
